# Workshop Abstract  
**Title:** Shift-Left Security Hands-On: Pulumi + Snyk Golden Path (Python)  
**Audience:** Platform & Security Engineers (beginner–intermediate IaC)  
**Duration:** 45–60 minutes  

## Overview  
This hands-on workshop demonstrates how **Pulumi** and **Snyk** work better together to “shift left” on security without slowing developers down. Participants will explore how insecure infrastructure is detected and remediated *before* it reaches production using Snyk’s IaC and container scanning capabilities, along with Pulumi’s policy-as-code guardrails and secure configuration management via Pulumi ESC.  

By the end of the session, learners will understand how to create and enforce **secure golden paths**—developer-friendly templates that automatically embed security, compliance, and secrets management into every deployment.  

## Objectives  
- Identify and remediate insecure IaC configurations using **Snyk IaC scans**.  
- Detect vulnerabilities in container images during CI/CD pipelines.  
- Enforce **Pulumi CrossGuard policies** to block misconfigurations at deploy time.  
- Use **Pulumi ESC** to eliminate plaintext secrets in code.  
- Understand how Pulumi and Snyk together deliver **defense-in-depth**: pre-commit → PR → deploy → runtime.  

## Key Takeaways  
- **Shift-left security:** catch issues early in the development cycle where they’re cheapest to fix.  
- **Consistent guardrails:** policy-as-code ensures all infrastructure meets org standards.  
- **Secrets made safe:** Pulumi ESC provides environment-scoped secrets instead of hardcoded credentials.  
- **Golden path enablement:** developers move fast and stay secure using pre-approved Pulumi templates.  

## Prerequisites  
- Basic familiarity with cloud infrastructure and Python.  
- Pulumi and Snyk accounts (free tier is sufficient).  
- Browser-based Instruqt environment (no local setup required).
